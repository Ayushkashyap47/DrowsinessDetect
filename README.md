# Drowsiness Detection ðŸ˜´ ðŸš— 

Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.
This project detects the eyes and yawn of the driver and generates an alert when the driver closes his/her eyes from more than 3-4 secs
